                Greetings! This site is all about history.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I believe every single person should have a rounded concept of the greatest events that have occurred during the time
                that history has been recorded.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Also, get a picture of the key characters of the past, both ''good' and 'bad'.
            </p>
