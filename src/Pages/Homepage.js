                Greetings! This site is all about history.

                I think everyone should have a rounded concept of the greatest events that have occurred during the time
                that history has been recorded.

                Also, get a picture of the key characters of the past, both ''good' and 'bad'.
            </p>

            </div>
        );
    }
}

export default Homepage;
